# Submodules

If you are conducting research / development and would like to open-source
deep-learning based solutions for problems making use of 3D / computer graphics
techniques, we would love to host your project in TensorFlow Graphics!

In order to provide you with both flexibility and visibility, the preferred
setup will be to have your project as a git submodule under
**tensorflow_graphics/submodules/PROJECT_NAME**. As a project owner, you set the
bar in terms of code quality, style, and tests. The only requirement is a
description of your project and how to use it inside
**tensorflow_graphics/submodules/PROJECT_NAME/README.md**. If your project is
linked to a publication, make sure to also include a link to the paper and a
bibtex describing how to cite your work.

If you have specific needs or requests, feel free to contact us at
tf-graphics-contact@google.com; we would love to work with you to find a
solution that fits your project!
