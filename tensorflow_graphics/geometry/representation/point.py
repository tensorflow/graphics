  """Computes the distance from a M-d point to a M-d ray.

  Note:
    In the following, A1 to An are optional batch dimensions, which must be

  Args:
    point: A tensor of shape `[A1, ..., An, M]`.
    origin: A tensor of shape `[A1, ..., An, M]`.
    direction: A tensor of shape `[A1, ..., An, M]`. The last dimension must be

    keepdims: A `bool`, whether to keep the last dimension with length 1 or to
      remove it.
    name: A name for this op. Defaults to "point_distance_to_ray".

  Returns:
