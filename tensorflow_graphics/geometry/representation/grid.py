  Warning:
    This op is not differentiable. Indeed, the gradient of tf.linspace and

  Args:
    starts: A tensor of shape `[M]` representing the start points for each
      dimension.
    stops: A tensor of shape `[M]` representing the end points for each
      dimension.
    nums: A tensor of shape `[M]` representing the number of subdivisions for

  r"""Generates a M-D uniform axis-aligned grid.

  Warning:
    This op is not differentiable. Indeed, the gradient of tf.linspace and
    tf.meshgrid are currently not defined.

  Note:
    In the following, `B` is an optional batch dimension.

  Args:
    starts: A tensor of shape `[M]` or `[B, M]`, where the last dimension
      represents a M-D start point.
    stops: A tensor of shape `[M]` or `[B, M]`, where the last dimension
      represents a M-D end point.
    nums: A tensor of shape `[M]` representing the number of subdivisions for
      each dimension.
    name: A name for this op. Defaults to "grid_generate".

  Returns:
    A tensor of shape `[nums[0], ..., nums[M-1], M]` containing an M-D uniform
      grid or a tensor of shape [B, nums[0], ..., nums[M-1], M]` containing B
      M-D uniform grids. Please refer to the example below for more details.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the shape of `starts`, `stops`, or 'nums' is not supported.

  Examples:
    ```python
    print(generate((-1.0, -2.0), (1.0, 2.0), (3, 5)))
    >>> [[[-1. -2.]
          [-1. -1.]

          [-1.  1.]
          [-1.  2.]]
         [[ 0. -2.]
          [ 0. -1.]
          [ 0.  0.]
          [ 0.  1.]
          [ 0.  2.]]

    Generates a 3x5 2d grid from -1.0 to 1.0 with 3 subdivisions for the x
    axis and from -2.0 to 2.0 with 5 subdivisions for the y axis. This lead to a
    tensor of shape (3, 5, 2).
