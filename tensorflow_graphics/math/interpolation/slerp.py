"""Tensorflow.graphics slerp interpolation module.

  Spherical linear interpolation (slerp) is defined for both quaternions and for
  regular M-D vectors, and act slightly differently because of inherent
  ambiguity of quaternions. This module has two functions returning the
  interpolation weights for quaternions (quaternion_weights) and for vectors
  (vector_weights), which can then be used in a weighted sum to calculate the
  final interpolated quaternions and vectors. A helper interpolate function is
  also provided.

  The main differences between two methods are:
  vector_weights:
    can get any M-D tensor as input,
    does not expect normalized vectors as input,
    returns unnormalized outputs (in general) for unnormalized inputs.

  quaternion_weights:
    expects M-D tensors with a last dimension of 4,
    assumes normalized input,
    checks for ambiguity by looking at the angle between quaternions,
    returns normalized quaternions naturally.
