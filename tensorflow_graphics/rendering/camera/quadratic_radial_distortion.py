"""Quadratic radial lens distortion and un-distortion functions.

Given a vector in homogeneous coordinates, `(x/z, y/z, 1)`, we define
`r^2 = (x/z)^2 + (y/z)^2`. We use the simplest form of distortion function,
`f(r) = 1 + k * r^2`. The distorted vector is given by
`(f(r) * x/z, f(r) * y/z, 1)`.

To apply the undistortion, we need the inverse of f(r), g = f^{-1}. In this
library we use the approximate formula for the undistortion function given here
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934233/, and refine the solution
using Newton-Raphson iterations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons_method).

Restricting the distortion function to quadratic form allows to easily detect
the cases where `r` goes beyond the monotonically-increasing range of `f` (which
we refer to as overflow).

  Given a vector describing a location in camera space in homogeneous

      radius rather than the radius itself to avoid an unnecessary `sqrt`, which
