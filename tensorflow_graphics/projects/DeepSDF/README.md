# DeepSDF

This repo contains a TensorFlow 2.x implementation of the paper ["DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Park_DeepSDF_Learning_Continuous_Signed_Distance_Functions_for_Shape_Representation_CVPR_2019_paper.html) by Park et al. The codes are based on [the authors's pytorch implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepSDF).

# How to Use DeepSDF
You can basically execute these codes in the same way as the original implementation. Please see README in [the original repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepSDF) about how to prepare the datasets or how to train/test the model.
