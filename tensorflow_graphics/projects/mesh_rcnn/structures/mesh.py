class Meshes:
  """Wrapper for batching of Triangle Meshes."""

  def __init__(self, vertices, faces, batch_sizes=None):
    """Contstructs the wrapper object from nested lists of multiple vertices and
    faces.

    Internally, vertices and faces are padded and packed into a single 2D
    tensor. The object provides accessors for different representations,
    including:

    * List: List of all unpadded vertices and faces tensors. This is intended as
        input format only. However, it is possible to retrieve a flat list of
        all vertices and faces tensor via `get_unpadded()`.
    * Padded: Tensor of shape `[A1, ..., An, max(N), 3]`, where max(N) is the
        size of the largest vertex (or face) list. All other vertex/face tensors
        get padded to this size.
    * Flattened: 2D tensor of shape `[sum(N1, ..., Nn), 3]`, where N1, ..., Nn
        are the sizes of every vertex or face list in this batch.

    Note:
      This implementation supports arbitrary batch dimensions by passing in the
      batch shapes in `batch_sizes`. The vertex and face lists must be flattened
      and reshapeable to the shape defined in `batch_sizes`. E.g. consider the
      case where 4 different meshes are to be stored in a Meshes object, the
      batched shape could be `[2, 2]`, `[4, 1]` or [`1, 4`]. In other words, the
      product over all entries in `batch_sizes` must be equal to the number of
      vertices and faces lists provided in the constructor.

    Args:
      vertices: List with N float32 tensors of shape `[V, 3]` containing the
        mesh vertices, or empty list.
      faces: List with N float32 tensors of shape `[F, 3]` containing the mesh
        faces, or empty list.
      batch_sizes: Optional list of ints indicating the size of each batch
        dimension for the meshes or None, if there is only one batch
        dimension.
