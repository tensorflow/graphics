"""Implementation of the VertAlign operation for Mesh R-CNN.

This operation is also called 'perceptual feature pooling' in Wang et al.

Given the 3D coordinate of a
vertex, this OP calculates its 2D projection on input image plane using camera
intrinsics, and then pool the feature from four nearby pixels using
bilinear interpolation.
