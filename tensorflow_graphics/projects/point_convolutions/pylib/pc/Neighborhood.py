"""Class to represent a neighborhood of points.

Note:
  In the following `D` is the spatial dimensionality of the points,
  `N` is the number of (samples) points, and `M` is the total number of
  adjacencies.

Attributes:
  _point_cloud_sampled: 'PointCloud', samples point cloud.
  _grid : 'Grid', regular grid data structure.
  _radii: `float` `Tensor` of shape [D], radius used to select the neighbors.
  _samples_neigh_ranges: `int` `Tensor` of shape `[N]`, end of the ranges per
    sample.
  _neighbors: `int` `Tensor` of shape `[M,2]`, indices of the neighbor point,
    with respect to the sorted point in the grid, and the sample for each
    neighbor.
  _original_neigh_ids: `int` `Tensor` of shape `[M,2]`, indices of the
    neighbor point, with respect to the points in the input point cloud,
    and the sample for each neighbor.
  _pdf: `float` `Tensor` of shape `[M]`, PDF value for each neighbor.
