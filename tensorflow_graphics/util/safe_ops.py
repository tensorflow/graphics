"""Safe divisions and inverse trigonometric functions.

  This module implements safety mechanisms to prevent NaN's and Inf's from
  appearing due to machine precision issues. These safety mechanisms ensure that
  the derivative is unchanged and the sign of the perturbation is unbiased.
  If the debug flag TFG_ADD_ASSERTS_TO_GRAPH is set to True, all affected
  functions also add assertions to the graph to ensure that the fix has worked
  as expected.
